OS and System Programming [2], lab #1

- Create a program that allows to move sprite (filed rectangle or an ellipse) inside of the client area using a keyboard and a mouse.
- Add mousewheel support. Scrolling moves sprite vertically. Holding Shift makes sprite move horizontally.
- Replace the sprite with a nonrectangular image.
- Implement sprite movement. The sprite should bounce from window borders.
